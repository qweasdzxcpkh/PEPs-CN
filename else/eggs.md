##  PEP 801 -- Reserved

> You’ve both reached out to me about the same topic and SO thread, so I hope you don’t mind me responding to you both. First, thanks for your love of Python! It’s a fantastic language, and even better community, and it’s been a great place to have spent the better part of my professional career.

> What better than a minor mystery in a corner of a language? Python, named after the Monty Python troupe, has a rich history of humor and easter eggs, so 801 could be nothing more than that. An enigma, wrapped in a riddle, stuffed into a conundrum. A turducken PEP.

> Maybe you’re right, and it’s the secret key that unlocks the Polish Python Ploy, a conspiracy of Warsawans to take over the language from the Dastardly Dutch Dozen. Or it could be a number, that when fed to a certain Python stdlib API, takes over your speakers and unstoppably plays the entire series of Flying Circus until you Silly Walk accurately in front of your webcam.

> I like to think it’s just a fun number that named a song and a band some people were into back in the day, coupled with the abuse of power from a mad PEP editor everyone else is too afraid to question. Only the Python Secret Underground (PSU) -which emphatically does not exist- knows for sure.

> Cheers,
